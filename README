In order to solve this, we need to generate the combinations of the string and then permute the string to check if they are valid dictionary words.

I did refer for the algorithm for generating the combinations, but permutations was a simple recursive program.
Downloaded the dictionary from:

https://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt
Read the entire dictionary into a hash set and then check if it containts the string.

In order to compile the given program:

javac Jumble.java

In order to run the given program

java Jumble <string to generate jumble for> dictionary.txt<attached>

Tested it for empty string ""
Numbers .
Invalid dictionary
Invalid command line arguments
